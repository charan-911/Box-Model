	<h1><u>Some Facts on the Honey Badger</u></h1>
    • A fully grown Honey Badger can measure upto a meter long(including the tail) and weigh upto 15 kg.<br>
    • Males are larger than Females.<br>
    • They don’t see very well but have a powerful sense of smell.<br>
    • Infact, a Badger’s sense of smell is 100x better than ours.<br>
    • Honey Badger’s skin is too tough and thick like military armor.<br> 
    • Their skin is also loosely connected to muscle making it almost impossible for a predator to get a grip.  <br>
    • Bee stings, porcupine quills, and animal bites rarely penetrate their skin.<br>
    • They have short thick legs and muscular shoulders.<br>
    • The feet are armed with very strong claws measuring upto 1.5 inch. <br>
    • They have strong sharp teeth and have jaw pressure powerful enough to crack open a small tortoise.<br>
    • They also have window like flaps over ears that close during an attack.
